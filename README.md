Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? ---
The client is a company that wants to create an online training to help people pass their drivers test. They wanted to 
build a web-based system that allowed users to be able to signup for classes and take tests completely online. The system needed
an infrastructure that can handle numerous users simultaneously and quickly. 

What did you do particularly well? ---- 
I believe I did the use case diagram well, though I missed a few key use cases in the begining about payments. But did add this in the final design.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would pick the class model to revise. I would have spent more time adding fileds and funtions to make sure that I was 
covering all requirements. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Being able to refer back to the interview was extremely helpful. I was able to extract the different actors for the system as well as the uses cases 
that the system needed. After creating all the diagrams, it was easy to see any holes in the requirements that needed to be filled. 
If we fail to consider the users needs in the design process there will be a lot of wasted development time when rewrite will inevitably need to happen when the 
user tests the system for the first time. The users are the ones that will be living in this system, and if they don't have a desirable, or at the least not a miserable
experience, they will move on and look for another application that suits their needs 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Making notes on big picture requirements is where I started. They I took each one of those larger requirements and broke them into smaller bits. 
I will be utilizing some of these diagrams in my current work load. I already use the class modeling to a certain extent, but have never 
tried using the Use Case diagram or a sequence diagram. I feel like those would help break a larger project into smaller, more manageable tasks
